# Google-Map-Filter

## Synopsis
This application is a single page featuring a map of my neighborhood which has the functionality to highlighted locations, filter locations and implementing third-party data(FourSquare) about those locations and various ways to browse the content.


## Motivaton
Through this project, I am more familiar with MVVM pattern by implementing Knockout frameworks and also familiar with bunch of Javascript libraries such as jQuery. Besides, this application is complex enough and incorporates a variety of data points that it can easily become unwieldy to manage. 

## Installation
